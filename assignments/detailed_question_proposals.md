# ECON 456: Senior Thesis Seminar

## 2 Detailed Question Proposals

One semester is a short period to complete a high-quality original research project. The objective of this assignment is to make you think about the project carefully and rigorously. Please complete the following tasks prior to our first one-on-one meeting. For each of two potential research questions answer the following questions. It is fine to organize your summary under 5 section headers. Write no more than 2 pages for each research question.

1. State your research question as precisely as possible.
2. What are the most closely related 3-5 academic research papers on this question or topic? Recent papers are preferable.
- What are their hypotheses and key findings?
- What data do they use to answer their questions? Can you obtain this data?
- Did they answer your question? If so, return to (1) and think about a slightly different question.
3. Data
- What are the data source(s) you found (i.e. downloaded and ready) that can help answer this question?
- What are the data sources you can potentially collect (manually collect, waiting approval for access, web-scrapping etc.) to answer this question?
- If you have trouble coming up with data, return to step 2 to check resources and find more literature to track down data. If that does not work return to step 1 to modify your question/hypothesis.
4. Approach
- What method does the closest related literature use to answer their question(s)?
- Does their methodology have a name (diff-in-diff, IV, RDD, FE, panel data, structural model, matching etc.)?
ii. Explain the intuition behind their central comparison. (e.g. they compare changes in rents for cities with and without limits on VRBO-type rentals).
- What methodology do you propose given your research question and data?
5. Contribution
- Suppose you completed the research project smoothly, what would you tell someone in a job interview about your project in 3 minutes? If you have trouble describing this, return to step 1 to sharpen your question
