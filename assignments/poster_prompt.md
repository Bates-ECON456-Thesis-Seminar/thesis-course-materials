# ECON 456: Senior Thesis Seminar

## SEND POSTER TO BE PRINTED APRIL 8th

## Final poster (Departmental Poster Session on 4/12 in Pettengill, 4:15-5:30pm)

This document provides suggestions for creating your poster. The structure is ultimately up to
you, but [this website from Washington State University](https://posters.wsu.edu/making-posters-with-powerpoint/) provides some good tips. One common template for a three-column poster is:

- Title at the top with your name and advisor directly below.
- Left column includes the following sections:
    - Research question
    - Relevant Literature
    - Image or Figure
- Middle column includes the following sections (which tell the audience “what I did”)
    - Data
    - Methods
    - Results
- Right column includes the following sections:
    - Main regression exhibit
    - Discussion / Implications
    - Acknowledgements (for example, who helped you or gave you data)

- You will find good examples of posters posted in the Economics/Sociology hallway in Pettengill and/or can ask prior econ thesis students.

## Poster Logistics and Department Presentation:

Bates requires posters to be submitted well in advance to ensure they are available when needed. Submit your poster by the end of the day on Monday, 4/8. [Follow the guidelines for Bates “post and print” found here](https://www.bates.edu/post-and-print/poster-printing/) and also [academics](https://www.bates.edu/academics/student-research/poster-session-2023/poster-mechanics/). **Set your poster size to 36” x 48” (landscape) before doing anything else.** I also recommend projecting your poster to see how it looks at that size to get a sense of if your fonts are large enough. (Note: projector screens are often a little larger than 36" x 48", but it gets you close.)

Please note - printing does cost $40 per poster. Bring your posters with you to Keck (Pettengill G52) 10-15 minutes before 4:15pm on Friday, 4/12. We will have display boards and push-pins ready for displaying posters. Invite friends, classmates etc., this is a celebration of your work! Light refreshments will be served.

You may use any software you like to create your poster. PowerPoint, Google Slides, Canva, Adobe Illustrator, LaTeX, RMarkdown, are all common choices. I recommend using PowerPoint/Google Slides because the postermaking with some of these other tools is a real pain. **Make sure you test that the RMarkdown or LaTeX approaches align with the Bates guidelines for poster printing BEFORE writing up your entire poster in that format. Do a small test with a title.** 

## In-class presentation:

Each student will provide a 3-5 minute "elevator pitch" of their poster on **Thursday, 4/11.** For this presentation, just use the electronic e.g. PowerPoint slide version of your poster. **Submit your slide via email by 9am on the presentation date.**

## Miscellaneous formatting tips:

- Try to use .pdf version of your figures over .png files. They are higher quality and will look better when printed.
    -  Do not stretch your images! This will make them look pixelated.
- Include a Bates Logo, your name, and your advisor's name on the poster. 
    - Bates logos can be grabbed here: https://www.bates.edu/communications-marketing/design-services-1/downloads/
- Use solid, light backgrounds -- gradient backgrounds are pretty nasty when printed.
- Leave 0.5" margin on the poster for printing purposes. Anything flush with the edge may be cut off.
- Check for "extraneous" boxes that may be hidden and delete them. "Select All" will show all boxes on the slide.
- Read, read, read Post & Print guidance for any specifics -- they have the latest updated info, while mine will be a little behind.
