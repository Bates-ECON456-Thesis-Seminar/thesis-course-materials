# Create Github Repository and Project Directory

## GitHub Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub. Use the template provided at https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-sample.

1. Make a GitHub account at github.com.
2. Sign up for the GitHub Student Developer Pack at https://education.github.com/pack.
3. Click the link to the [thesis-sample](https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-sample).
4. Click `Use this template` in the upper-right corner of the repository.
5. Click `Create a new repository`.
6. Name your repository and click `Create repository from template`.
 - Any name will do! I recommend something snappy that describes the project topic and that it is a thesis with dashes between words. (e.g. `swiftonomics-bates-thesis`, `ui-expiration-bates-thesis`)
 - I suggest starting by making it Private, not Public.

## Clone Repository

There are countless ways to interact with GitHub repositories. I recommend using GitHub Desktop if you are just starting out.

1. Download GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
 - This is a good way to manage your repository on your computer.
 - See a tutorial here: [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).
 - Also the [Git in five minutes](https://alicelepissier.com/git-tutorial/slides.html) by Alice LÃ©pissier.
2. Clone the repository to your computer to a location you can find again later.
 - This is critical! If you cannot find the folder on your computer, you will not be able to work on your project.
 - This is where you will store all of your project files.
 - If you cannot find the folder, you can likely find it by right-clicking on the repository in GitHub Desktop and selecting `Show in Explorer` (Windows) or `Reveal in Finder` (Mac). If you are not sure how to find files on Linux, you should probably not be using Linux.

## Push/pull for the first time

1. Change the title in the README.md file to something that describes your project. (e.g. # Swiftonomics: A Bates Thesis)
2. In Github Desktop, stage the change by clicking the checkbox next to the README.md file.
3. Commit the change by writing a brief description of the change in the Summary box and clicking `Commit to main`.
4. Pull the change from the repository on GitHub by clicking `Pull origin`. (This is a good habit to get into to make sure you are working with the most recent version of the repository.)
5. Push the change to the repository on GitHub by clicking `Push origin`.
6. Check the repository on GitHub to make sure the change is there.

If you can do all of this, you are ready to start working on your project. If you need help, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).
