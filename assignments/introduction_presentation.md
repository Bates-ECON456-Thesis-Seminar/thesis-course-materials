# ECON 456: Senior Thesis Seminar

## Topic Proposal Presentation and Introduction Writeup

Each student will present their prospective capstone topic to the class. You should plan on presenting for 9-12 minutes. _Note: 12 minutes is a hard cap to allow everyone time to present._ Your presentation should include the following elements:

### Writeup due: Feb 8th

For 2/8, please submit a draft of your introduction^[All economists’ introductions have the same function, but they may have different forms. Many economists follow Keith Head’s “introduction formula”. You may find the introduction formula to be a useful template. (But McCloskey (1985) reminds you to “avoid boilerplate”.)
] in your GitHub repository and bring two hard copies to class. Your draft should cover each of the elements above (to the extent possible). Remember that an introduction is outlining your entire paper, from motivation to a results preview! I am not providing a specific page limit, but I suspect 4-7 pages will be reasonable in most cases. I encourage you to re-read several introductions from published economics articles as part of your preparation.

1. You should clearly motivate your general research topic. In other words, put yourself in the position of your reader, who might be wondering...
- Why is your topic interesting?
- Why should I care?
The answers that you provide in your proposal should be grounded in economics, in particular by placing the research topic into context within a specific subject within economics (that is, what economics class would cover this topic?).

2. You should clearly state your specific research focus. This assignment should help you begin to narrow the focus of your final paper. 
- You should have a well-defined research question. Please highlight your research
question in bold font.
- You should include a hypothesis that discusses what you intend to be your main findings, hypothesis, or argument. Note: this will change as your research progresses. The hypothesis will likely be about 2 to 3 sentences. Please indicate your hypothesis by italicizing the font.
- You should clearly state the value-added of your research.

3. Include a review of the literature, that is a discussion of the "antecedents" of your research question. Essentially, give a brief story of the how the literature has evolved from its initial work to the narrow focus of your research question.

Be sure to:

- Highlight the seminal papers (those cited by many people)
- Highlight the papers that are most similar to yours (in terms of question and/or findings)

Highlight the gaps in this literature that your research will fill. Do not insult the authors you cite. 

4. State three expected contributions of your work. These contributions should be specific and should be grounded in the literature you reviewed. Perhaps you:

- Measure a relationship that has not been measured before.
- Measure an old relationship in a new way.
- Test a theory in a new context.
- Provide a new dataset that can be used to answer other questions.
- Provide a new method that can be used to answer other questions.
- Or several other contributions! 

5. You should propose a plan for your research. The plan should include the following.
- A specific outcome variable and specific explanatory variable of interest.
- The expected effect of the explanatory variable of interest and an explanation of that expectation.
- An identification strategy and a brief explanation for the strategy.

6. You should describe the original data and provide the reader with all the relevant
information needed to understand the methodology and interpret the empirical results.
This description should include:

- Ideal data: Describe the ideal dataset for your research question. What variables would you have? What time period would you cover? What is the unit of observation?

- Data Description: You should provide the source(s) of the data you are using and the period it covers. Describe whether you have a panel, cross-sectional or time series; what the unit of analysis is (individual, state, county, province, nation, etc.); and how many observations you have.

- Limitations: Discuss any limitations of the data such as missing variables, missing observations, small number of observations, etc. Report other obvious shortcomings (i.e. no income data; no men interviewed, only people attending school interviewed, etc.). It is useful to think about what the ideal dataset would be for the hypothesis you want to test and compare your data to it.

7. You should provide a short outline of the sections that you intend to include in your final paper. This outline can be in bullet point form on a separate page.

8. You should provide clear answers to questions from the audience. (Presentation only)

9. You should follow the following formatting guidelines.

## Presentation: 

1. Basic Motivation: What is the question that you are answering? Why should we care? Why isn’t it obvious? You should discuss the economic mechanisms that may drive potential results.
2. Related Literature: What papers have looked at similar topics? What have they found? How is your topic different than the related literature (i.e. what is your novel contribution)? Are you using different data? Different methods?
3. Data: What data will you need and how will you start/continue finding them. _Note that a later presentation will focus exclusively on this aspect of your project._
4. Methodology: What estimation techniques will you employ? _Note that a later presentation will focus exclusively on this aspect of your project. For now, focus on the big picture intuition (what’s the core comparison + technique)._
5. Potential Results: What results might you find? How would different findings help answer the paper’s major question?

You will be assigned a presentation date on Feb 1. Please share your slides with me before the start of class on your presentation date (either Google Slides or as slides in your GitHub repository).
