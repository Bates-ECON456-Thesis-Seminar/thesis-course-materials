# ECON 456: Senior Thesis Seminar

## Annotated Bibliography & Research Question

The annotated bibliography is a precursor to the proposal. The purpose of these assignments is for you to familiarize yourself with the previous literature and start to place your research in context. You will complete the following assignments:

### Thesis: Annotated Summary

### Thesis: Annotated Bibliography

- Identify academic, peer-reviewed articles in economics that you plan to cite; and
- Write an annotated summary of each article, following the guidance below.

Good databases to search for an article include those that you can access through the Ladd Library website, including EconLit, JSTOR, and ScienceDirect, as well as Google Scholar. Good keywords to start with when searching for an article may include JEL codes. Keep in mind that your first search may not yield a good article to cite. But your initial search results may help you refine your keywords for subsequent searches for a good article.

The annotated bibliography should contain, for each source, three key elements:

1. **Citation**: Each source should be cited using Chicago style.
2. **Summary**: You should provide a summary or paraphrase the main arguments of the article or book. Consider this your version of the paper’s abstract that includes information that is pertinent to your research question. In other words, do not simply paraphrase the abstract the authors provide. This should include:
    - The motivation for the paper;
    - A discussion of the methodology used;
    - A summary of the key findings;
    - Main conclusions or policy prescriptions.
3. **Reflection**: Provide a discussion of how this source connects with your research. How do you envision using this source in your final paper? Did the source provide evidence that changed your perspective?

You do not need subheadings here, just provide the citation followed by the full annotation, organized alphabetically by source. The minimum number of academic, peer-reviewed sources you should be citing and discussing is five (5). There is no maximum; however, please keep in mind that there is a page limit, and it will be difficult to include an extremely large number of sources. In general, you should use sources beyond those required for class readings. Academic working papers are acceptable, such as those from NBER, Brookings Institution, or Federal Reserve Banks. You should not include data sources in your annotated bibliography, but you should be beginning to identify potential sources of data at this stage.

Part of this assignment requires you to explain the authors’ arguments in your own words and how these findings fit into the context of your research question. You must engage with the authors, rather than blindly accepting their arguments. You can be critical of the authors’ methodology and/or results, but you must do so with appropriate justification. In your writing, please use present tense and active voice and avoid the use of contractions.

This assignment should help you begin to refine the focus of your final thesis. These sources will likely be a subset of the sources used in your literature review and final thesis. In other words, you will need more sources than the ones used in this assignment, and your research question may evolve such that some of the sources in this assignment may not appear in your final thesis.

At the end of this document, you should indicate your research question and preliminary hypothesis. You will likely want to write this part after you complete your research for the annotated bibliography. Highlight your research question in **bold** and italicize your hypothesis.

Keep in mind the following elements of a good research question and hypothesis:

#### Research question
- Well-defined
- Innovative
- Implies causality
- Narrow

#### Hypothesis
- Clearly indicates your findings, hypothesis, or argument
- Sophisticated
- Answers “so what,” “how,” and “why”
- Detailed
- Specific
- Uses active verbs
- Creates tension
- Moves beyond a summary
