## Peer review

Each of you will switch papers with a partner. Then we will spend 20 minutes reading each other's papers and marking them up and getting a sense. I will ask you to post to your partner's GitHub Discussion posts to answer the following questions:

### Summary 

- What question is the proposal asking? Restate it in your own words. 
- What is the hook they use to draw you into the proposal? 
- What methods are used to answer the question? 
- What data will be used?
- What contributions does the proposal make?

### Evaluation

- Can you think of potential problems (endogeneity, no parallel trends, messy data) with the methodology?
- What confused you about the proposal? 
- Does the hook align with the question?
