Please write up a brief explanation and upload to your GitHub repository in a "Notes" folder. 

## Previous Thesis Report

Choose one of the past theses posted on the course website to (a) read carefully and (b) write a
thesis report that addresses the 7 points below.

1. State the research question as precisely as possible.
2. Motivation
- What arguments does the author provide about why the question/topic is
interesting?
- Did you find these compelling? Why or why not?
3. What contribution does the thesis provide relative to what was known previously?
4. Data
- What data source(s) does the author use?
- Describe briefly any big changes they made before their analysis (e.g. aggregating
to a different level of observation, merging in additional data).
5. Approach
- Briefly summarize their methodology
- Does their methodology have a name (diff-in-diff, IV, RDD, FE, panel data,
structural model, selection on observables)?
- Explain the intuition behind their central comparison. (e.g. they compare changes
in rents for cities with and without limits on VRBO-type rentals).
- Based on the author’s description, what assumptions must the reader believe in
order for their method to correctly answer their question? Alternatively, what
types of things would be problematic for the author’s method (What kinds of
omitted variables could create bias? How would their key assumptions be
violated?)
6. Results
- Describe their key results as clearly as possible
- Choose one additional result the author presents and discuss how it adds to the
paper
7. Extension – describe the next thing you would have encouraged the author to do if they
had more time.
