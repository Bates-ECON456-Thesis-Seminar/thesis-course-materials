# ECON 456: Senior Thesis Seminar

## Data Section

This document is intended to give you some guidelines for your Data presentations and write-
ups. For the presentation, make sure to start by reminding the class of your research topic. Your
data section should:

1. Explain the process of how and where you obtained your data.
2. Provide descriptive statistics. Depending on your project, this may take the form of simple
tables or graphs reporting means, standard deviations, correlations, etc. OR it may include more
complex data visualization or tabular evidence. Remember, your goal is to set the stage for your
later analysis.
3. Explain why you have chosen your dependent variable(s) and why you feel the set of control
variables is appropriate. Why do your measured variables allow you to address your researchable
question?
4. Discuss any problems with your data such as missing observations, measurement error. etc.
and how you handle them.

Your presentation should discuss the progress that you have made towards each of these criteria.
Most of you should have complete responses for each item, but in some instances data assembly
may remain incomplete. If you are in this scenario, please clear it with me and present what you
can as well as a plan for incomplete elements.

###  Writeup: Due March 14th

For Thursday 3/14, please submit a draft of your data
section in your GitHub repository and bring two hard copies to class. Your draft should cover each of the elements
above (to the extent possible). I am not providing a specific page limit, but I suspect 3-6 pages will
be reasonable in most cases. I encourage you to re-read several data sections from published
economics articles as part of your preparation.
