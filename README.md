# Senior Thesis course materials

This repository contains those materials used to provide guidance on the Winter 2024 thesis seminar taught by Professor Kyle Coombs. This is a living syllabus that students can use to navigate the course. 

## Class times

Tuesdays from 7:30pm to 10:30pm.

### E-mail: kcoombs@bates.edu

You can also tag me @kgcsport in Issues and Discussions. 

### Office: Pettengill 161

Full syllabus is available [here](https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-course-materials/blob/main/syllabus.md) or as a [PDF](https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-course-materials/blob/main/syllabus.pdf).

## Getting started: Make template
Make a template of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-sample). 

1. Create a GitHub Account
2. Click the link to the [thesis-sample](https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-sample).
3. Click `Use this template` in the upper-right corner of the repository.
4. Click `Create a new repository`.
5. Name your repository and click `Create repository from template`.
    - Any name will do! 
    - I suggest starting by making it Private, not Public.
6. Download GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
    - This is a good way to manage your repository on your computer.
    - See a tutorial here: [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).
    - Also the [Git in five minutes](https://alicelepissier.com/git-tutorial/slides.html) by Alice LÃ©pissier.
7. Clone the repository to your computer to a location you can find.
    - This is critical! 
8. Change a single file in the repository on your computer.
9. Stage, commit, and push the change to the repository on GitHub to test that everything is working.
10. Add @kgcsport as a collaborator to your repository.

This gives an example of a well-structured empirical thesis. You can use this as a starting point for your own project to stay organized. 

## Turning in work

### Coding assignments

Turn in all code on your thesis in your GitHub repository. I will evaluate it for being well-structured. 

### Feedback branch

For all iterative assignments, I will ask you to create a branch called `feedback` and push my comments on your work to that branch. This will allow me to see your changes and provide feedback on them without changing your main branch. 

### Writing assignments

I will evaluate writing assignments for clarity, grammar, and content. I will also check whether you have followed the guidelines and are engaging with the literature well. 

I will provide track changes and comments. Heavy edits are a good thing to get. It is how to make your work better. 

#### LaTeX/Markdown

I encourage you to use a markdown or LaTeX file to write your thesis. They are designed for academic writing and make updating figures, equations, tables, and references easy. If you use markdown/LaTeX, please turn in the associated `.md`, `.Rmd`, or `.tex` file along with a PDF of the final document.

#### WYSWYG editors: Microsoft Word and Google Docs

If you choose to use Microsoft Word, you can push the `.docx` to your repository. If you are using Google Docs, please provide a link to the Google Doc in your README file. 

These are called WYSWYG (What You See is What You Get) editors. They are more user-friendly, but make it much more tedious to keep figures, equations, tables, and references up-to-date.

### Issues submitting work

If you have issues submitting work with GitHub. Please let me know. I can help you with the process.

Write an email with the subject "[ECON 456] Cannot submit work" and describe the issue. Attach the file you are trying to submit and I will provide feedback on the file. 

Then we will meet to resolve the issues. 

## Why Thesis?

Building on experience from previous economics courses, students in this course produce new
independent research. Students will find a researchable idea, execute their idea, and present their
results in both oral and written formats. The structure of the class is intended to provide you support
in key areas of doing research such as finding an appropriate topic, finding and manipulating data,
and placing your results in the related literature. All students are expected to provide feedback
on the projects of other students in the class. In this class, all students are expected to actively
participate and arrive prepared to do so. Students who are blatantly unprepared may be asked to
leave: expectations are very high.
