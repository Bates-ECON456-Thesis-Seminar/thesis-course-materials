## Why Thesis?

Building on experience from previous economics courses, students in this course produce new
independent research. Students will find a researchable idea, execute their idea, and present their
results in both oral and written formats. The structure of the class is intended to provide you support
in key areas of doing research such as finding an appropriate topic, finding and manipulating data,
and placing your results in the related literature. All students are expected to provide feedback
on the projects of other students in the class. In this class, all students are expected to actively
participate and arrive prepared to do so. Students who are blatantly unprepared may be asked to
leave: expectations are very high.
