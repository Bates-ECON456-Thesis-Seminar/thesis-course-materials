# ECON 456: Senior Thesis Seminar

## Topic Proposal Presentation and Introduction Writeup

Each student will present their prospective capstone topic to the class. You should plan on presenting
for 9-12 minutes. _Note: 12 minutes is a hard cap to allow everyone time to present._ Your
presentation should include the following elements:

### Writeup due: Feb 1st

For 2/1, please submit a draft of your introduction in your GitHub repository and bring two hard copies to class. Your draft should cover each of the elements above (to the extent possible). Remember that an introduction is outlining your entire paper, from motivation to
a results preview! I am not providing a specific page limit, but I suspect 4-7 pages will be reasonable
in most cases. I encourage you to re-read several introductions from published economics articles as
part of your preparation.


1. You should clearly motivate your general research topic. In other words, put yourself in
the position of your reader, who might be wondering…
- Why is your topic interesting?
- Why should I care?
The answers that you provide in your proposal should be grounded in economics, in particular
by placing the research topic into context within a specific subject within economics (that is,
what economics class would cover this topic?).
2. You should clearly state your specific research focus. This assignment should help you
begin to narrow the focus of your final paper.
- You should have a well-defined research question. Please highlight your research
question in bold font.
- You should include a hypothesis that discusses what you intend to be your main findings,
hypothesis, or argument. Note: this will change as your research progresses. The
hypothesis will likely be about 2 to 3 sentences. Please indicate your hypothesis by
italicizing the font.
- You should clearly state the value-added of your research.
3. You should propose a plan for your research. The plan should include the following.
- A specific outcome variable and specific explanatory variable of interest.
- The expected effect of the explanatory variable of interest and an explanation of that
expectation.
- An identification strategy and a brief explanation for the strategy.
1 All economists’ introductions have the same function, but they may have different forms. Many economists
follow Keith Head’s “introduction formula”. You may find the introduction formula to be a useful template.
(But McCloskey (1985) reminds you to “avoid boilerplate”.)

4. You should describe the original data and provide the reader with all the relevant
information needed to understand the methodology and interpret the empirical results.
This description should include:
- Data Description: You should provide the source(s) of the data you are using and the period
it covers. Describe whether you have a panel, cross-sectional or time series; what the unit
-f analysis is (individual, state, county, province, nation, etc.); and how many observations
you have.
- Limitations: Discuss any limitations of the data such as missing variables, missing
-bservations, small number of observations, etc. Report other obvious shortcomings (i.e.
no income data; no men interviewed, only people attending school interviewed, etc.). It is
useful to think about what the ideal dataset would be for the hypothesis you want to test
and compare your data to it.
5. You should provide a short outline of the sections that you intend to include in your final
paper. This outline can be in bullet point form on a separate page.
6. You should provide clear answers to questions from the audience. (Presentation only)
7. You should follow the following formatting guidelines.

## Presentation: 

1. Basic Motivation: What is the question that you are answering? Why should we care? Why isn’t
it obvious? You should discuss the economic mechanisms that may drive potential results.
2. Related Literature: What papers have looked at similar topics? What have they found? How is
your topic different than the related literature (i.e. what is your novel contribution)? Are you using
different data? Different methods?
3. Data: What data will you need and how will you start/continue finding them. _Note that a later presentation will focus exclusively on this aspect of your project._
4. Methodology: What estimation techniques will you employ? _Note that a later presentation will focus exclusively on this aspect of your project. For now, focus on the big picture intuition (what’s the core comparison + technique)._
5. Potential Results: What results might you find? How would different findings help answer the
paper’s major question?

You will be assigned a presentation date on Feb 1. Please share your slides with me before the start of class on your presentation date (either Google
Slides or a PDF via email).
